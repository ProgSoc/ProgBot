1. Find a project you're interested in on the [Github](https://github.com/${organisation}).
1. Find a feature you would like to add or a bug you would like to fix. This can either be something you've found yourself or something from the issues tab. This can be anything from a small typo fix to a large new feature.
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repository and clone it to your local machine.
1. Get a development environment set up. Most of the projects will contain instructions in their READMEs.
1. Add your changes and test locally. Make sure to follow the project's coding style, add comments to anything that might be unclear, and run any tests or formatters that are specified for the project. Be tidy and make sure not to include any unnecessary changes. If you're adding multiple features or fixes, consider creating separate [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and PRs for each.
1. Push your changes to your fork and create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Make sure to outline what you have done in the PR description. If you've fixed an issue, you can [reference it in your PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
1. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR. They may ask for changes or approve it.
